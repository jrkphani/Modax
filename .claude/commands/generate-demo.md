## Demo Components

### 1. Sample Legacy Application
```javascript
// Legacy code example for transformation
function calculateDiscount(customer, product) {
  // Complex nested logic
  if (customer.type === 'gold') {
    if (product.category === 'electronics') {
      return 0.15;
    } else if (product.category === 'clothing') {
      return 0.20;
    }
  }
  // More complex rules...
}
```

### 2. ModAx:Intel Analysis Output

    },
    {
      "name": "Product",
      "attributes": ["category", "price", "inventory"],
      "relationships": ["discounts", "suppliers"]
    }
  ],
  "businessRules": [
    "Gold customers get 15% off electronics",
    "Loyalty tier affects discount rates",
    "Category-based pricing rules"

// Generated modern React component
export function DiscountCalculator() {
  const { customer, products } = useStore();
  const { calculateOptimalDiscount } = useAI();
  
  return (
    <Card className="p-6 space-y-4">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Intelligent Pricing</h2>
      <CustomerSelector value={customer} onChange={setCustomer} />
      <ProductGrid products={products} />
      <AIRecommendations 
        discount={calculateOptimalDiscount(customer, products)}
        insights={generateInsights(customer)}
      />
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### 4. ModAx:Smartify Agent
```typescript
// AI Agent for pricing optimization
class PricingAgent {
  async optimizePrice(context: BusinessContext) {

    const customerBehavior = await this.predictBehavior();
    
    return {
      recommendedPrice: this.calculateOptimal(context),
      confidence: 0.89,
      reasoning: "Based on seasonal patterns and customer segment",
