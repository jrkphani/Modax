## Unique Positioning Strategies

### 1. The "Failed POC Rescuer"
No one else explicitly targets failed experiments. This is our blue ocean.

**Message:** "Everyone else wants to start fresh. We start with your sunk costs and turn them into investments."

### 2. The "AWS Funding Maximizer"
Large SIs can't offer AWS funding. Small firms don't know how.

**Message:** "Get enterprise-quality transformation at startup prices with 80% AWS funding."

### 3. The "Production-First Pioneer"
Others build POCs hoping for production. We build production from day one.

**Message:** "POCs are for vendors. Production is for winners."

### 4. The "90-Day Transformer"
While others plan, we deliver.

**Message:** "Their kickoff meeting is our go-live celebration."

### 5. The "Business-Led Revolutionary"
IT-led transformations fail. Business-led transformations scale.

**Message:** "Empower your business users, not your IT gatekeepers."
