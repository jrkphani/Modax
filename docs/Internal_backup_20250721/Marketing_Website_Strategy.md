- **Customer Benefit**: 50-80% cost reduction on initial project
- **Hidden Agenda**: Get inside, map their landscape

**Example Pitch:**
> "AWS will fund 80% of making your GenAI experiment production-ready. You pay only $30K for a $150K transformation."

**AWS MAP (Migration Acceleration Program)**
- **Funding**: $100K - $500K based on migration commitment
