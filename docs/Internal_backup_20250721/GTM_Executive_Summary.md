## The One-Page Strategy

### Our Mission
Transform failed GenAI experiments into production systems in 90 days, then evolve them into enterprise intelligence platforms.

### Our Enemy
The GenAI Graveyard—where 73% of POCs go to die, wasting millions in investment and crushing innovation momentum.

### Our Hero
The frustrated innovation leader who knows AI can transform their business but can't get past IT gates, data deserts, and ROI fog.

### Our Weapon
ModAx—the production-first framework that resurrects failed POCs with AWS funding covering 80% of costs.

### Our Strategy
1. **Enter through the side door** (failed POCs, not new initiatives)
2. **Prove value fast** (90 days to production)
3. **Expand from success** (one win becomes ten)
4. **Transform from within** (evolution, not revolution)

## The Three-Story Framework

### Story 1: The Graveyard (Problem)
"Your POCs failed. You're not alone. Here's why it happened and why it's not your fault."

### Story 2: The Resurrection (Solution)
"We take your best failed experiment and make it production-ready in 90 days with 80% AWS funding."

### Story 3: The Transformation (Vision)
"That first success becomes your bridge from legacy chaos to enterprise intelligence."
