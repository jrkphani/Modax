```

### The Problem Section

```
Title: Welcome to the GenAI Graveyard

Statistic Blocks:
- 73% of GenAI POCs never reach production
- $4.5M average wasted on failed experiments  
- 18 months typical time to production
- 0 business value from dead POCs

Body Copy:
You've seen the demos. You've felt the excitement. You've invested in pilots.
But your GenAI experiments are gathering dust while competitors race ahead.

The problem isn't the technology. It's the approach.

Your POCs failed because they were built for demos, not production.
They ignored IT requirements. They couldn't access real data. 
They had no path to scale.

You don't need another experiment. You need production.
```

### The Solution Section

```
Title: The ModAx Bridge: From Experiments to Intelligence

Step 1: Resurrect
We take your most promising failed experiment and understand why it died.
Unlike others, we see failure as intelligence, not waste.

Step 2: Productionize  
In 90 days, we transform it into a production-ready system with:
- Enterprise security built-in
- Real data integration
- Scalable architecture
- Measurable ROI

Step 3: Evolve

for broader transformation. We map your landscape and identify the next
10x opportunities.

Step 4: Transform

AI-native enterprise where every application thinks, every data point
informs, and every decision improves.

## About Us

### Our Story Page

```
Headline: Born from Frustration. Built for Production.

Our Story:
We watched too many enterprises waste millions on GenAI experiments
that never saw the light of day. POCs that amazed in boardrooms but
died in IT reviews. Investments that promised transformation but
delivered PowerPoints.

We knew there had to be a better way.

So we built ModAx—not another POC platform, but a production-first
framework that takes failed experiments and transforms them into
business value.

We don't believe in pilots. We believe in production.
We don't sell experiments. We deliver evolution.

Our Philosophy:
- Start small, think big
- Production-first, always
- Business value over technology
- Evolution over revolution

Our Track Record:
- 50+ failed POCs resurrected
- 90-day average to production
- 300% average ROI
- 80% AWS funding secured

73% of GenAI POCs never reach production.

We take a different approach:
Production-first. Always.

Your failed POC could be producing value in 90 days.
With 80% AWS funding.

## FAQs

```
Q: How is this different from our previous POC attempts?
A: We build for production from day one. Enterprise security, real data integration, scalable architecture—all built in, not bolted on.

Q: What if we don't have failed POCs?
A: We can identify high-impact use cases and build production-ready solutions from scratch. But honestly, if you've been experimenting with GenAI, you probably have some failed POCs.

Q: How does AWS funding work?
A: As an AWS Advanced Partner, we structure projects to maximize funding from programs like RAPID, MAP, and ISV Accelerate. Most clients get 60-80% funding.

Q: Can you work with our existing IT requirements?
A: That's exactly why we exist. We build everything to enterprise standards from day one. Your IT team will love us.

Q: What happens after 90 days?
A: You have a production AI system delivering value. We then help you identify the next opportunities for expansion, building toward your intelligence platform.
