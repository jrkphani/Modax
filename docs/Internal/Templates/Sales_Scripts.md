## 1. Cold Calling Scripts

### Initial Cold Call (30 seconds)

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from ModAx. I know you weren't expecting my call, so I'll be brief. 

We help companies like [similar company] transform their legacy applications into AI-ready systems in just 90 days, typically reducing maintenance costs by 50%.

I'm calling because I noticed [specific trigger about their company]. 

Do you have 27 seconds for me to explain how this might apply to [Company]?"

[If yes, continue to 60-second pitch]
[If no, ask for better time]
```

### 60-Second Pitch

```
"Perfect, thank you. 

Every enterprise has decades of valuable business logic trapped in legacy systems. The problem is, these systems are expensive to maintain and impossible to enhance with modern capabilities like AI.

ModAx doesn't just modernize these applications – we extract and preserve all that business intelligence into what we call an Intelligence Fabric. This means your modernized apps don't just run cheaper and faster – they actually get smarter over time.

We guarantee the first application in production within 90 days. For [similar company in their industry], this meant [specific result].

I'd love to show you exactly how this would work for [Company]. Do you have your calendar handy?"
```

### Voicemail Script

```
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] from ModAx.

I'm reaching out because we've helped companies like [similar company] cut their legacy system maintenance costs in half while making their applications AI-ready.

Given [Company]'s [specific situation/trigger], I thought this might be relevant.

I'll send you a brief email with more details. If you'd like to discuss how we could help [Company] modernize your critical applications in just 90 days, please call me back at [number].

Again, [Your Name] at [number]. Thank you."
```

## 2. Discovery Call Scripts

### Opening & Agenda Setting

```
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I've blocked 45 minutes for our call – does that still work for you?

Great. Here's what I'd like to accomplish:
1. Understand your current application landscape and challenges
2. Share how ModAx approaches modernization differently  
3. Identify if there's a potential fit worth exploring further

Before we dive in, what prompted you to take this call? What's happening at [Company] that made application modernization a priority?"
```

### Pain Discovery Questions

```
COST PAIN:
"Walk me through your IT budget. What percentage goes to just keeping the lights on versus innovation?"
"What would you do with an extra $[X] million per year if you weren't spending it on legacy maintenance?"

SPEED PAIN:
"How long does it take to implement a simple change in your [system]?"
"Can you share an example of a business opportunity you missed because the technology couldn't keep up?"

TALENT PAIN:
"How difficult is it to find developers who know [legacy technology]?"
"What's your contingency plan when [key person] who knows these systems retires?"

COMPETITIVE PAIN:
"How are your competitors using AI and modern technology?"
"What capabilities do you wish you had but can't implement with current systems?"
```

### Qualifying Questions

```
BUDGET:
"Typically, our engagements start around $250K for the first application, though with cloud funding this often comes down to $50-75K. Is that within the range you were thinking?"

AUTHORITY:
"If we were to move forward, who else would need to be involved in the decision?"
"What's your typical approval process for transformation initiatives?"

NEED:
"On a scale of 1-10, how critical is solving this problem in the next 6 months?"
"What happens if you don't modernize these systems?"

TIMELINE:
"When would you ideally want to see the first modernized application in production?"
"What's driving that timeline?"
```

### Transition to Next Steps

```
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [summarize their pain points]. Is that accurate?

I believe we can definitely help. Here's what I'd suggest as next steps:
1. I'll send you a brief summary of our discussion
2. We schedule a technical deep-dive with your team
3. We provide a preliminary assessment and proposal

What questions do you have for me?"
```

---

## 3. Demo Scripts

### Demo Introduction

```
"Thanks everyone for joining. Today I'll show you exactly how ModAx transforms legacy applications in 90 days.

Rather than generic slides, I'm going to walk you through a real transformation we did for [similar company]. They had a [similar system] just like yours, and I'll show you:
1. How we analyzed their legacy code
2. What we discovered in their business logic
3. The modern system we delivered
4. The results they're seeing today

Feel free to interrupt with questions – this is your time."
```

### Intelligence Fabric Explanation

```
"This is the key differentiator. See this legacy COBOL code? Our platform doesn't just convert it to Java or Python. It extracts the business intent – the 'why' behind the code.

For example, this 500-line subroutine is actually implementing a complex discount calculation based on customer history, seasonality, and inventory levels. Our Intelligence Fabric captures that as a semantic business rule that ANY modern system can understand and query.

Imagine being able to ask your AI: 'What are all the ways we calculate customer discounts?' and getting a complete answer across ALL your applications. That's what the Intelligence Fabric enables."
```

### ROI Demonstration

```
"Let me show you the numbers from [similar company]:

[Share screen with ROI dashboard]

Before ModAx:
- $2.3M annual maintenance
- 6-week deployment cycles
- 5 dedicated maintenance developers
- 15 hours average incident resolution

After ModAx (Year 1):
- $1.1M annual costs (52% reduction)
- 2-day deployment cycles
- 2 developers for enhancement
- 2 hours average incident resolution

But here's what excites me most – they've launched 3 new AI-powered features that were impossible with the legacy system. That's generated an additional $4M in revenue.

Based on your situation, here's what I project for [Company]..."
```

## 4. Objection Handling Scripts

### "We've tried modernization before and it failed"

```
"I hear that a lot, and honestly, it's why we built our 90-day approach. Tell me, what went wrong with the previous attempt?

[Listen actively]

That's exactly the problem we solve. Unlike traditional modernization that tries to boil the ocean, we:
1. Start with ONE high-value process
2. Get it completely into production in 90 days
3. Prove the value before expanding

We've designed our entire methodology around the failures of traditional approaches. 

Would you be open to seeing how we did this successfully for [company that had failed before]?"
```

### "It's too expensive"

```
"I understand cost is a concern. Let me put this in perspective:

You mentioned you're spending $[X] million annually on maintenance. Our typical project costs $250K, and with AWS funding, your out-of-pocket is often just $50-75K.

If we deliver even a 30% reduction in maintenance costs – and we typically achieve 50% – you'll save $[Y] in year one alone. That's a [Z]-month payback period.

But honestly, the cost savings are just the beginning. The real value is in what becomes possible – AI capabilities, faster innovation, competitive advantage.

What would need to be true about the ROI for this to make sense for you?"
```

### "We don't have time for a big project"

```
"That's exactly why we guarantee 90 days – because we know you can't afford lengthy disruptions.

Here's what '90 days' really means:
- Your team involvement: 5-10 hours per week after week 2
- Zero disruption to current operations
- New system running in parallel before cutover
- Phased approach – see value before committing more

In fact, [similar company] said this was less disruptive than their regular maintenance work.

What if I could show you a detailed week-by-week plan that proves this won't derail your operations?"
```

### "Our systems are too complex"

```
"I love hearing that because complex systems are where we add the most value. 

We've successfully modernized:
- A 40-year-old banking system with 3 million lines of COBOL
- An insurance platform with 400+ integration points
- A manufacturing ERP modified over 30 years

Our automated analysis tools are built specifically for complexity. The more complex the logic, the more valuable the Intelligence Fabric becomes.

What makes you think your system is more complex than these examples?"
```

## 5. Closing Scripts

### Trial Close Questions

```
"Based on what we've discussed, do you see how ModAx could help [Company] achieve [their stated goal]?"

"If we could deliver everything I've shown you, what would that mean for your organization?"

"What concerns do you have that would prevent us from moving forward?"

"On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that ModAx is the right solution? What would make it a 10?"
```

### Assumptive Close

```
"Great, it sounds like we're aligned on the value ModAx can deliver. Let's talk about timing.

We have capacity to start your project in [timeframe]. The first step is a 2-week assessment where we'll:
1. Analyze your priority system
2. Define the exact scope for 90-day delivery
3. Confirm the investment and funding options

Should we schedule that for [week of X] or would [week of Y] work better?"
```

### Summary Close

```
"Let me summarize what we've discussed:

Your challenges:
- [Pain point 1]
- [Pain point 2]
- [Pain point 3]

Our solution:
- Modernize [system] in 90 days
- Reduce costs by [X]%
- Enable [specific capabilities]

Investment:
- Total project: $[X]
- With funding: $[Y] your cost
- ROI: [Z] months

Next steps:
1. I'll send the proposal by [day]
2. You'll review with your team
3. We'll reconnect on [day] to discuss

What questions can I answer to help you make the best decision for [Company]?"
```

### Creating Urgency

```
"I want to be transparent about timing. We're seeing unprecedented demand, and our delivery slots for Q[X] are filling quickly.

More importantly, every month you delay is costing you approximately $[X] in maintenance and lost opportunities.

If we started in [month], you'd have a modernized system by [date], just in time for [relevant business event/cycle].

What would need to happen for us to secure your slot for [timeframe]?"
```

---

## 6. Expansion Scripts

### Planting Seeds (Week 4 of Project)

```
"By the way, while we were analyzing your order processing system, we mapped out your invoice processing flow too. The same patterns we're applying here could eliminate about 20 hours of manual work per week in that process. Should I make a note to discuss that after we finish the current project?"
```

### Demonstrating Additional Value (Week 8)

```
"I wanted to show you something interesting. The Intelligence Fabric we've built for order processing can actually answer questions about your invoicing too since they're connected. Watch this... [demonstrate]

We could extend this to invoicing with minimal effort. But let's stay focused on launching order processing first. Just wanted you to see what's possible."
```

### Expansion Conversation (Post-Launch)

```
"Congratulations again on the successful launch! Now that you've seen what's possible, I wanted to share some opportunities we identified during the project.

[Show 1-page opportunity summary]

We could tackle any of these in a similar 90-day sprint. Based on the ROI from the first project, which of these would create the most value for [Company]?

No pressure – your current system works great standalone. Just wanted to make sure you knew what else was possible."
```
